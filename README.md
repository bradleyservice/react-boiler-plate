<h1>React App Boiler Plate</h1>

This repo is designed with ease-of-setup in mind for my future projects. These are tools or packages that have assisted me in my career thus far and have become integral in my coding toolbox. So much time is wasted on setting up a new project (or stripping out all the unnecessary stuff from running a command like `create-react-app`), I wanted to make it easier on myself in the future.

Clone the repo, run `npm i` and have a blast!

Cheers!
